Covid Chatbot and Dynamic Website
Motivation:
The coronavirus outbreak has major consequences for society worldwide. People are rightly concerned and have many urgent questions. The World Health Organization provides answers to frequently asked questions 
regarding the coronavirus on their website. However, you may have to search for a while before you have found 
the right answer to your question. It is vital that people are well informed about current measures. This way we 
can efficiently limit mass spread. We strive to innovate and come up with better solutions to the current problem 
of pandemic and hence we thought a chatbot would be perfect with this. Whether via text, phone, websites, or 
communication apps, conversing with chatbots can play a critical role in helping communities quickly 
understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues.
